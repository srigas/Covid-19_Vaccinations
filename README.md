# Covid-19 Vaccinations
The present repository contains code written in R, used in order to perform partial data cleaning and exploratory data analysis on coronavirus vaccination data pulled from [this](https://github.com/RamiKrispin/coronavirus) repository.

This project was part of a course in the Data Science & Machine Learning Post-Graduate MSc programme in the National Technical University of Athens (NTUA). The code is split into separate scripts which are numbered according to the order in which their output appears in the project's [report](https://github.com/srigas/Covid-19_Vaccinations/blob/main/Report.pdf) and are thus expected to be executed in this order.

Among the main topics investigated in this analysis are world-wide comparisons between fully and partially vaccinated population ratios, the continent-wise distribution and availability of vaccines, as well as the hysteresis-like shape of the vaccination time-series curves.
